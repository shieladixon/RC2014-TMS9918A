# RC2014-TMS9918A

I love the RC2014 modular form factor and the fact that it's an 8-bit computer built from new parts. Personally, though, I have no nostalgia for terminals and serial communication. 

RC2014 + TMS

The addition of a video card takes the RC2014 to another level. The TMS9918A is a very capable chip, it has a text mode, tile mode, multicolour bitmap mode and 32 16x16 sprites. Video RAM is 16k of dedicated RAM which is in addition to your machine's regular RAM and communication with the video ram is very fast. 

There is a small library of software for RC2014+TMS video card and I am actively adding to it. Porting programs and games from other systems with similar screen resolutions or the same video chip is easy and I found porting 3D Monster Maze lots of fun.
