This folder contains my sprite designer for RC2014+TMS; an ihx for 32k machines and .com for cpm-based machines.

Here's a video in which I demonstrate the sprite designer. The code for the little demo is in this folder so that you can see how the sprite data fits into the program, is copied to VRAM and then the sprite attributes manipulated.
